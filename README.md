# Wordpress Media Tag Gallery
A Wordpress media tag gallery that extends the Media Tags plugin.

*[Media Tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-tags/ "Media Tags")* is a great plugin that allows you to add 
tags to your media - something that should come out of the box. However, the **Media Tag Gallery** takes it to 
another level by adding the ability to pull in your photos by tag names to create a simple, yet flexible way to 
great you gallery. No need for bloated image gallery plugins that just become outdated over time.
